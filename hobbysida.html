                <h1>Evolution of european one-handed swords</h1>
                <h2>Gladius (ca. -200-200)</h2>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Uncrossed_gladius.jpg"

                <p>
                    The gladius was the primary weapon of the Roman legions for most of its history.
                    It has a short and broad blade optimised for thrusting, and a simple hilt with no crossguard, typically made from wood or ivory.
                </p>
                <h2>Spatha (ca. 0-300)</h2>
                <img src="https://cdn.webshopapp.com/shops/32318/files/453186820/680x680x2/late-roman-spatha-rhineland.jpg"

                <p>
                    The spatha is a roman sword similar in construction to the gladius, but with a longer and narrower blade.
                    It was contemporary with the gladius, with the gladius being favored by infantry and the spatha by cavalry.
                    However, around year 200 it began to supplant the gladius for use by the roman infantry as well.
                    The gladius was presumably favored by the infantry for the greater durability afforded by its squatter blade,
                    but as metallurgical technology improved this advantage became less relevant, allowing the infantry to
                    switch to the spatha for its greater reach and cutting ability.

                <h2>Migration period sword (ca. 300-600)</h2>

                <p>
                    Swords of this type were used throughout Europe during the migration period, after the fall of Rome.
                    The blade shape is similar to the spatha, fairly long and narrow with little taper, and ofter with a somewhat rounded tip.
                    The blade is typically forged from pattern-welded steel, and the pommel and crossguard are flatter and broader,
                    and usually reinforced with metal, either steel, bronze, or sometimes gold.
                </p>
                <h2>Carolingian sword (ca. 600-900)</h2>

                <p>
                    This is the typical sword used by the germanic peoples during the early medieval period, including by the vikings.
                    The blade is broader at the base with a stronger taper compared to earlier swords, and often has a pronounced fuller.
                    The crossguard and pommel are forged from solid steel, and the pommel often has this distinctive semicircular or lobed design.
                </p>
                <h2>Knightly sword (ca. 900-1400)</h2>

                <p>
                    The classic sword used during the high medieval period.
                    The blade is similar in profile to earlier designs, typically longer and with a more pronounced point. It may or may not have a fuller.
                    The crossguard is wider and narrower with clearly defined quillons. The pommmel may have a variety of styles, but is typically narrower to give more space for the hand.
                </p>
                <h2>Sidesword (ca. 1400-1600)</h2>

                <p>
                    A sword from the Renaissance period originating in Italy. The blade is longer and narrower than the knightly sword,
                    and the hilt is significantly more complex, featuring long and thin quillons, a narrow, elongated pommel,
                    and rings above the crossguard which allows putting a finger over the guard for greater control without leaving it exposed.
                    It may also feature a side-ring and/or a knuckle bow.

                    A sword derived from the sidesword, with a very long and narrow thrusting-oriented blade.
                    The hilt is very complex, and comes in a few different styles. The elegant swept hilt is typical for italian rapiers.
                    The cup hilt typical for spanish rapiers is probably more protective but significantly less stylish.
                    Later styles like Pappenheim or clamshell hilts offer a balance between practicality and drip.
