            <h1>Evolution of european one-handed swords</h1>
            <h2>Gladius (ca. -200-200)</h2>

            height="300">
            <p>
                The gladius was the primary weapon of the Roman legions for most of its history.<br>
                It has a short and broad blade optimised for thrusting, and a simple hilt with no crossguard, typically made from wood or ivory.
            </p>
            <h2>Spatha (ca. 0-300)</h2>
            <img src="https://cdn.webshopapp.com/shops/32318/files/453186820/680x680x2/late-roman-spatha-rhineland.jpg"
            alt="Reproduction of a spatha"
            height="300">
            <p>
                The spatha is a roman sword similar in construction to the gladius, but with a longer and narrower blade.<br>
                It was contemporary with the gladius, with the gladius being favored by infantry and the spatha by cavalry.<br>
                However, around year 200 it began to supplant the gladius for use by the roman infantry as well.<br>
                The gladius was presumably favored by the infantry for the greater durability afforded by its squatter blade,<br>
                but as metallurgical technology improved this advantage became less relevant, allowing the infantry to<br>
                switch to the spatha for its greater reach and cutting ability.
            </p>
            <h2>Migration period sword (ca. 300-600)</h2>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Spadalongobarda.jpg"
            alt="Reproduction of a lombard sword from the migration period"
            height="500">
            <p>
                Swords of this type were used throughout Europe during the migration period, after the fall of Rome.<br>
                The blade shape is similar to the spatha, fairly long and narrow with little taper, and ofter with a somewhat rounded tip.<br>
                The blade is typically forged from pattern-welded steel, and the pommel and crossguard are flatter and broader,<br>
                and usually reinforced with metal, either steel, bronze, or sometimes gold.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Carolingian sword (ca. 600-900)</h2>
            <img src="https://d2r50eqdykdm5j.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AH6981R_ST_L.jpg"
            alt="Reproduction of a 10th century viking sword"
            height="300">
            <p>
                This is the typical sword used by the germanic peoples during the early medieval period, including by the vikings.<br>
                The blade is broader at the base with a stronger taper compared to earlier swords, and often has a pronounced fuller.<br>
                The crossguard and pommel are forged from solid steel, and the pommel often has this distinctive semicircular or lobed design.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Knightly sword (ca. 900-1400)</h2>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e7/I09_526_Reichsschwert_%28cropped%29.jpg/1024px-I09_526_Reichsschwert_%28cropped%29.jpg" 
            alt="The Imperial Sword of the Holy Roman Empire"
            height="300">
            <p>
                The classic sword used during the high medieval period.<br>
                The blade is similar in profile to earlier designs, typically longer and with a more pronounced point. It may or may not have a fuller.<br>
                The crossguard is wider and narrower with clearly defined quillons. The pommmel may have a variety of styles, but is typically narrower to give more space for the hand.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>Sidesword (ca. 1400-1600)</h2>
            <img src="http://myarmoury.com/images/reviews/dw_ss_a.jpg" 
            alt="Reproduction sidesword"
            height="200">
            <p>
                A sword from the Renaissance period originating in Italy. The blade is longer and narrower than the knightly sword,<br>
                and the hilt is significantly more complex, featuring long and thin quillons, a narrow, elongated pommel,<br>
                and rings above the crossguard which allows putting a finger over the guard for greater control without leaving it exposed.<br>
                It may also feature a side-ring and/or a knuckle bow.
            </p>
            <h2>Rapier (ca. 1500-1700)</h2>
            <img src="https://spqr.se/media/image/10/db/c6/hn-sh1092b_hanwei_korbrapier_mit_knochengriffozMZ0mRqjopJG.jpg"

            alt="Reproduction cup hilt rapier"
            height="300">
            <p>
                A sword derived from the sidesword, with a very long and narrow thrusting-oriented blade.<br>
                The hilt is very complex, and comes in a few different styles. The elegant swept hilt is typical for italian rapiers.<br>
                The cup hilt typical for spanish rapiers is possibly more protective but significantly less stylish.<br>
                Later styles like Pappenheim or clamshell hilts offer a balance between practicality and drip.<br>

            <p>The difference is primarily defined by how the bevor opens.</p>

                <h3>Armet</h3>
                <p>An armet is an earlier style of helmet. It has a bevor that hinges outwards. It may be in one or two pieces.</p>
